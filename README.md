# JS-Applications-Exam
My solution for JS Applications exam from SoftUni

To see the solution in action do the following things:
1. Go in the folder called "server" and run the bat file. Don't close it until you're done because this resets the server.
2. Open "softwiki" in an IDE like VS Code and in the terminal use the command "lite-server" or use live server. Both work well.
3. Go to the localhost link with the port you're using and enjoy the application.
